<p><i>This project is created exclusively for educational purposes. Current status: working, unfinished.</i></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, at the time of writing, I had no idea of callback and Promise at all. So an attempt to perform 
 asynchronous functions similarly to synchronous ones leaded the application became unstable and I couldn't finish it. </p>

 This application is a browser notebook with the ability to quickly, without delay, work with large amounts  of text.
 The entered text is automatically saved when you go to another page, insert a page, finish working with a document.
 A dynamically updated bookmark system displays the 5 nearest pages left and right of the currently open,
 10 pages that have been viewed or edited recently, and tabs marked as special. Color marking should facilitate
 navigation.</p>
 <br>
 <p><b><i>A page with an open document might look like this </i></b></p>
 <br>
  <div style="border: 1px solid #8c8c8c;">
  <img src="src\main\resources\static\img\readme_img\doc_editing.jpeg" alt="home_window" width="1200"/>
  </div>
