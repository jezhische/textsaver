 This application is a browser notebook with the ability to quickly, without delay, work with large amounts  of text.
 The entered text is automatically saved when you go to another page, insert a page, finish working with a document.
 A dynamically updated bookmark system displays the 5 nearest pages left and right of the currently open,
 10 pages that have been viewed or edited recently, and tabs marked as special. Color marking should facilitate
 navigation.
